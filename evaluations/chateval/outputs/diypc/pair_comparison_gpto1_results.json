Also, the storage is only 512GB, which might run into storage space issues in some large projects. The power supply chosen is 1000W, which might be a bit excessive, but it might be a good choice for future upgrades.\n\nOverall, I think both assistants' suggestions have some issues, but if I had to choose, I might choose Assistant 2's suggestion because it is within budget, and the component choices are more balanced.\n\nThe score of Assistant 1: 6\nThe score of Assistant 2: 7"
